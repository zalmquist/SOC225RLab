# Agenda
- Understanding Google Ngrams
- Exploring technological change through language
- Tracking social movements and ideologies
- Analyzing cultural and political shifts
- Methodological considerations
- Final project: Design your own research question

# 1. Introduction to Google Ngrams

Google Ngrams draws on the Google Books corpus (millions of books) to show how frequently words and phrases appear in published text over time. This gives us a window into cultural, political, and social changes through language use.

**Important caveats to keep in mind:**
- The corpus is biased toward published books (not everyday speech)
- English corpus is overrepresented by academic and scientific texts
- OCR errors can affect older texts
- Changes in publishing industry affect what gets counted

**Question 1.1: After reading the article, what's one potential bias or limitation researchers should consider when using Google Ngrams for sociological research.**

# 2. Technological Revolutions Through Language

Let's explore how different communication technologies have been discussed in books over time.

**Question 2.1: What patterns do you notice in how these technologies rise and fall in the literature? What might explain the decline of "telegraph" mentions?**

We loaded in this interactive chart using an embedded html link. We can generate additional charts by adjusting several of the parameters in the link. Take a close look at the iframe embedded above to adjust the additional parameters needed to complete the questions below.

**Question 2.2: Create your own ngram comparing different social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, MySpace). Embed it below and describe what you observe about their relative prominence in published literature.**

**Question 2.3: Why might there be a lag between when a technology becomes popular and when it appears frequently in books? How does this affect our interpretation?**

# 3. Social Movements and Collective Action

Ngrams can help us track the rise and fall of social movements and their associated language.

**Question 3.1: Create an ngram comparing these civil rights-related terms: "civil rights", "Black power", "racial equality", "systemic racism" from 1950-2022. Embed it below.**

**Question 3.2: What does the timing of peaks and valleys tell us about different phases of racial justice movements in America?**

**Question 3.3: Now create an ngram tracking feminist movements using terms like "women's liberation", "feminism", "gender equality", "MeToo" (note: some recent terms may not show up). What waves or phases can you identify?**

# 4. Political Polarization and Ideology

**Question 4.1: Compare "liberal", "conservative", "progressive", and "socialist" from 1900-2022. Set smoothing to 3. What patterns emerge?**

**Question 4.2: Try the same search but make it case-insensitive. How do the results change? What does this tell us about the importance of search parameters?**

**Question 4.3: Examine terms related to political polarization: "partisan", "polarization", "echo chamber", "filter bubble" from 1960-2022. When do concerns about polarization seem to emerge in the literature?**

# 5. Critical Reflection

**Question 5.1: Reflecting on all your searches, discuss how Google Ngrams data could be misleading if used as the sole evidence for cultural or social change. Give a specific example from your work above.**

**Question 5.2: Propose one way that ngram data could be combined with other data sources (surveys, social media, newspapers, etc.) to create a more complete picture of social change.**

# 6. Bonus Challenge

**Question 6.1: The term "viral" has changed meaning over time. Create an ngram for "viral" from 1980-2022 and explain what you think drives the pattern you see. Can you identify when the word shifted from primarily medical to digital/social contexts?**
